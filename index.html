            <h1 class="section-header">About</h1>
            <p> During the last year (a challenging year for all of us!), I discovered a brand new world... coding.
                From the very basics of HTML, to CSS and JavaScript, I became passionate from day one, and since then
                I've been study hard,
                every day, to get better, so I could do what I've always loved to do: tell stories. <span>Your
                    story<span>.
            </p>
            <h1 class="section-header">How can I be useful?</h1>

            <p> What can I offer is sheer passion, commitment, and trust. You can be sure I will always be in the first
                line, striving to make your vision real, and share it with the world. Listening and serving people it's
                what
                I always did for a living; people from all around the world, from all kind of backgrounds. I'll make
                sure
                your story is well told in all the languages and ways I know.
            </p>

                In this long travel, I bring a backpack that I constantly refill or empty depending on the challenges
                ahead.I will share them with you, hoping you will find them useful too; and if not, that we can review what's

                Along with these tools, for our travel I carry nice food, fresh water and a couple of other things that we can share when we're not walking, 
                climbing or swimming (all things I love) through the endless possibilities of this vast world. I'm <span>storyteller</span>; in a professional way, 
                with my background as a salesman, and artistical, through writing and music. I bring an atmosphere of <span>energy</span> and <span>humor</span>. 
                Together with <span>trust</span>, a strong <span>will to learn</span>, <span>flexibility</span> and <span>empathy</span>, I believe this is the recipe for overcoming any challenge. 
                 Well, enough
                about me for now; the sun is high, a gentle fresh breeze blows; I will tell you more while we walk, if
                you wish. What about you? How can we help each other?
                How can we grow together? I'm looking forward to discover what can you teach me.
            </p>
